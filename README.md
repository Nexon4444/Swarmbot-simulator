Installing cairo on Windows

cairocffi needs a libcairo-2.dll file in a directory that is listed in the PATH environment variable.

Alexander Shaduriâ€™s GTK+ installer works. (Make sure to leave the Set up PATH environment variable checkbox checked.)
Pycairo on Windows is sometimes compiled statically against cairo and may not provide a .dll file that cairocffi can use.  

pip install slycot
pip install control
